How to use the [Debug Visualizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.debug-visualizer) in VS Code:

1. Install the Debug Visualizer by Henning Dieterichs in Extensions.
2. Put a breakpoint on line 26 of `sorting.py`.
3. `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open Command Palette, then type in "Debug Visualizer: New View".
4. Type in `serialized` in the Debug Visualizer's prompt. This allows you to visualize your serialized list object from the Python file.
5. Run the `sorting.py` file using VS Code's built in debugger.
